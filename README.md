# TMS570 BSP

Bare Metal Board Support Package for Texas Instruments Cortex-R4F/R5F TMS570
MCUs.

TMS570 Transportation MCUs are ARM Cortex-R4F based floating point MCUs that meet IEC61508/SIL3 safety standards. Targeted transportation safety applications include automotive chassis and stability control, electric power steering, hybrid and electric vehicles, aerospace, railway communications, and off-road vehicle engine control.

The TMS570 family integrates dual Cortex-R4F and Cortex-R5F processors in lock-step and is designed to meet automotive and transportation safety standards. These devices provide system-wide protection through seamless support for error detection from the processor, through the bus interconnect, and into the memories.

## Getting started

* Rust nightly as default toolchain
  * Latest tested: `rustc 1.30.0-nightly (4141a4079 2018-09-25)`
* Add an armebv7r target:
  * Hard-float: `rustup target add armebv7r-none-eabihf`
  * Soft-float: `rustup target add armebv7r-none-eabi`
* GCC v7.3.2 for ARM: `sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-none-eabi`
* JTAG programmer: Lautherbach Trace32 Powerview for ARM or OpenOCD or SEGGER Jlink
